Let me brutally be honest while I'm about to submit this assignment. Whatever code that i have used in this assignment is crystal-clear a well-lit case of plagiarism. I never wanted to this but I kind of had to. I tried really hard to create my own version of the "Quiz App Assignment" but i couldn't do it. Unfortunately, HTML and CSS part is easy but the JS part has completely blowed my mind. Succintly, i just need more time to understand the fundamentals of JavaScript. The reason I'm having difficulty with writing the code is that I'm actually from the management background. I don't know what i was thinking at the time when I picked up the "Full Stack Web Development Course". I should have gone for the "Digital Marketing" instead. Pity me!. Now, rather than regretting what I had do, I should push myself more into coding so that I can fully understand how coding is functional, literally. I beg you my pardon, dear evaluator, bacause I have failed to feel lived up to your expectations. All I need more deliberation and practice in this direction until I feel like that I'm getting good at it.
